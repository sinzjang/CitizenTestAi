1,,,1,"The most important rule and the supreme law of the land is the Constitution (Q. 1). This great blueprint serves three core functions: it sets up the government, defines the government, and most importantly, protects the basic rights of Americans (Q. 2). The first three words of this blueprint are ""We the People,"" making it clear that all power comes from the people (Q. 3).","Constitution, sets up the government, defines the government, protects the basic rights of Americans, We the People",,
1,,,2,"A blueprint cannot be perfect forever, so it needs updates as times change. A change or addition to the Constitution is called an amendment (Q. 4).

1,,,3,"Before the Constitution was created, the American people sent a letter to the King of Great Britain saying, ""We will no longer follow your rules!"" This is the Declaration of Independence.

It states three core rights that all human beings are born with: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (Q. 9).","Declaration of Independence, announced our independence (from Great Britain), life, liberty, pursuit of happiness",,

Within this free environment, the United States adopted a capitalist or market economy system that respects private property and effort (Q. 11). Lastly, one of the most cherished rights for Americans, the freedom of religion, means that you can practice any religion, or not practice a religion, without government interference (Q. 10).","rule of law, no one is above the law, everyone must follow the law, capitalist or market economy, freedom of religion, you can practice any religion, or not practice a religion",,
