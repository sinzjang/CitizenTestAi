1,1,0,title,Blueprint for Freedom: The Birth of the Constitution,Chapter 1 Title
2,1,0,introduction,"Before the United States became a nation, the great Founding Fathers drew up the most important 'blueprint.' Without this Constitution, today's America would not exist.",Chapter 1 Introduction
3,1,1,section,"Once upon a time, there were people who dreamed of freedom and justice. As they established a new nation, they declared: ""We shall live as a Republic, under the principles of a Constitution-based federal republic, and create a nation of Representative democracy where people govern themselves through representatives!"" (Q.1). The supreme law supporting their promise was the Constitution (Q.2). This Constitution was not just words; it was the backbone and the promise of the nation. Within it were provisions to form the government, define the powers of government, define the departments of government, and most importantly, protect the rights of the people (Q.3). And the first sentence of the Constitution began: ""The Constitution begins with 'We the People.'"" Here, the phrase ""We the People"" symbolizes Self-government, Popular sovereignty, Consent of the governed, People should govern themselves, and a Social contract (Q.4). However, the Constitution was not a document written once and left untouched. To allow for amendments and additions as times changed, amendments to the U.S. Constitution were created through the Constitutional amendment process (Q.5). Among the most famous of these amendments are the Bill of Rights. These provisions protect the basic rights of Americans and the basic rights of people living in the United States (Q.6). To date, a total of 27 amendments have been added to the Constitution (Q.7). But everything began with one document: the Declaration of Independence. That document declared that the United States was free from British control, stated that all men are created equal, and defined unalienable rights and individual liberty (Q.8, Q.9). That document and the Constitution together conveyed core values such as Equality, Liberty, Social contract, Right to life, Limited government, and Self-government (Q.10). And the words deeply etched in people's hearts, ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,"" came from the Declaration of Independence (Q.11). Built upon these ideas, the U.S. economy follows the principles of Capitalism and a free market economy (Q.12). Yet, even a free nation needed order. Thus, the concept of the Rule of Law emerged, establishing the principle that everyone must follow the law, leaders must obey the law, government must obey the law, and no one is above the law (Q.13). In the process of creating this Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the Federalist Papers, the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the Mayflower Compact, and the Great Law of Peace of the Iroquois Confederacy had a great influence (Q.14). And finally, the United States created three branches to prevent power from concentrating in one place. This is the principle of Separation of powers and Checks and balances, designed so that no one branch becomes too powerful (Q.15).","Ch1 Sec1 | Questions: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
4,2,0,title,The Lawmakers: Birth of Congress,Chapter 2 Title
5,2,0,introduction,"After establishing the Constitution, the Founding Fathers needed an institution to make laws. They created Congress, a special body divided into two chambers, each with its own role.",Chapter 2 Introduction
6,2,1,section,"The Founding Fathers, who decided to divide power, separated the government into three branches. The first is the Legislative branch, which makes laws; the second is the Executive branch, which enforces laws; and the third is the Judicial branch, which interprets laws. These are also known as the Congress, the President, and the Courts (Q.16). Among them, the President of the United States is responsible for the Executive branch (Q.17). And the department that writes laws in the federal government is the U.S. Congress, which is the Legislative branch (Q.18).","Ch2 Sec1 | Questions: [16, 17, 18]"
7,2,2,section,"This Congress had a special structure. It was divided into two chambers. One is the [ANSWER:Senate] and the other is the [ANSWER:House of Representatives] (Q.19). This Congress had immense power. It could [ANSWER:write bills], decide to [ANSWER:declare war], and was responsible for [ANSWER:creating the federal budget] (Q.20).","Ch2 Sec2 | Questions: [19, 20]"
8,2,3,section,"First, let's learn about the Senate, shall we? There are a total of [ANSWER:100] U.S. Senators (Q.21). Each Senator serves for a term of [ANSWER:6 years], working for a relatively long period (Q.22). Your state also has Senators. Their names vary by state, but each state must have two Senators (Q.23).","Ch2 Sec3 | Questions: [21, 22, 23]"
9,2,4,section,"Now, let's look at the House of Representatives. There are many more members of the House. There are a total of [ANSWER:435] (Q.24).

The reason is to [ANSWER:follow public opinion more closely], to hear the voices of the people more often (Q.26). Here's an interesting point. Each state has [ANSWER:2] Senators (Q.27). Why do all states have exactly two? This is to ensure [ANSWER:equal representation for smaller states]. This is famously known as the [ANSWER:Great Compromise], or the [ANSWER:Connecticut Compromise] (Q.28). Your area also has a House member (Q.29), and the House also has a Speaker who leads all members (Q.30).","Ch2 Sec4 | Questions: [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"
10,2,5,section,"So, who do these representatives represent? A Senator represents the [residents of their state] (Q.31). And the people who elect the Senator are also the [residents of their state] (Q.32). House Representatives are a little different. They represent [citizens of their congressional district], or rather, the [people of that district] (Q.33). And the ones who elect the House Representatives are the [citizens of their congressional district] (Q.34). In this way, Congress became an important institution that speaks for the voice of the people.","Ch2 Sec5 | Questions: [31, 32, 33, 34]"
