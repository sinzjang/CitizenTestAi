1,1,0,title,Blueprint for Freedom: The Birth of the Constitution,自由蓝图：宪法诞生,Chapter 1 Title
2,1,0,introduction,"Before the United States became a nation, the great Founding Fathers drew up the most important 'blueprint.' Without this Constitution, today's America would not exist.",在美国建国之前，伟大的开国元勋们绘制了最重要的“蓝图”。没有这部宪法，今天的美国就不会存在。,Chapter 1 Introduction
3,1,1,section,"Once upon a time, there were people who dreamed of freedom and justice. As they established a new nation, they declared: ""We shall live as a Republic, under the principles of a Constitution-based federal republic, and create a nation of Representative democracy where people govern themselves through representatives!"" (Q.1). The supreme law supporting their promise was the Constitution (Q.2). This Constitution was not just words; it was the backbone and the promise of the nation. Within it were provisions to form the government, define the powers of government, define the departments of government, and most importantly, protect the rights of the people (Q.3). And the first sentence of the Constitution began: ""The Constitution begins with 'We the People.'"" Here, the phrase ""We the People"" symbolizes Self-government, Popular sovereignty, Consent of the governed, People should govern themselves, and a Social contract (Q.4). However, the Constitution was not a document written once and left untouched. To allow for amendments and additions as times changed, amendments to the U.S. Constitution were created through the Constitutional amendment process (Q.5). Among the most famous of these amendments are the Bill of Rights. These provisions protect the basic rights of Americans and the basic rights of people living in the United States (Q.6). To date, a total of 27 amendments have been added to the Constitution (Q.7). But everything began with one document: the Declaration of Independence. That document declared that the United States was free from British control, stated that all men are created equal, and defined unalienable rights and individual liberty (Q.8, Q.9). That document and the Constitution together conveyed core values such as Equality, Liberty, Social contract, Right to life, Limited government, and Self-government (Q.10). And the words deeply etched in people's hearts, ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,"" came from the Declaration of Independence (Q.11). Built upon these ideas, the U.S. economy follows the principles of Capitalism and a free market economy (Q.12). Yet, even a free nation needed order. Thus, the concept of the Rule of Law emerged, establishing the principle that everyone must follow the law, leaders must obey the law, government must obey the law, and no one is above the law (Q.13). In the process of creating this Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the Federalist Papers, the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the Mayflower Compact, and the Great Law of Peace of the Iroquois Confederacy had a great influence (Q.14). And finally, the United States created three branches to prevent power from concentrating in one place. This is the principle of Separation of powers and Checks and balances, designed so that no one branch becomes too powerful (Q.15).",从前，有些人梦想着自由和正义。当他们建立一个新国家时，他们宣布：“我们将以共和国的形式生活，遵循基于宪法的联邦共和国原则，并创建一个人通过代表治理自己的代议制民主国家！”（Q.1）。支持他们承诺的最高法律是宪法（Q.2）。这部宪法不仅仅是文字；它是国家的支柱和承诺。其中有组建政府、定义政府权力、定义政府部门以及最重要的是保护人民权利的条款（Q.3）。宪法的第一句话是：“宪法以‘我们人民’开头。”在这里，“我们人民”这句话象征着自治、人民主权、被统治者同意、人民应该自我治理以及社会契约（Q.4）。然而，宪法不是一份一劳永逸的文件。为了随着时代的变化进行修正和补充，美国宪法修正案是通过宪法修正程序创建的（Q.5）。这些修正案中最著名的是《权利法案》。这些条款保护美国人的基本权利以及生活在美国的人民的基本权利（Q.6）。迄今为止，宪法共增加了27条修正案（Q.7）。但一切都始于一份文件：《独立宣言》。该文件宣布美国脱离英国控制，声明人人平等，并定义了不可剥夺的权利和个人自由（Q.8，Q.9）。该文件和宪法共同传达了平等、自由、社会契约、生命权、有限政府和自治等核心价值观（Q.10）。而深深烙印在人们心中的“生命、自由和追求幸福”这些话语，则来自《独立宣言》（Q.11）。在此基础上，美国经济遵循资本主义和自由市场经济的原则（Q.12）。然而，即使是一个自由的国家也需要秩序。因此，法治概念应运而生，确立了每个人都必须遵守法律，领导人必须遵守法律，政府必须遵守法律，没有人凌驾于法律之上（Q.13）。在制定这部宪法的过程中，《独立宣言》、《邦联条款》、《联邦党人文集》、《弗吉尼亚权利法案》、《康涅狄格基本法》、《五月花号公约》以及《易洛魁联盟和平大法》产生了巨大影响（Q.14）。最后，美国创建了三个分支机构，以防止权力集中在一个地方。这就是三权分立和制衡的原则，旨在防止任何一个分支机构变得过于强大（Q.15）。,"Ch1 Sec1 | Questions: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
4,2,0,title,The Lawmakers: Birth of Congress,立法者：国会诞生,Chapter 2 Title
5,2,0,introduction,"After establishing the Constitution, the Founding Fathers needed an institution to make laws. They created Congress, a special body divided into two chambers, each with its own role.",在制定宪法之后，开国元勋们需要一个机构来制定法律。他们创建了国会，一个分为两院的特殊机构，每个机构都有自己的职责。,Chapter 2 Introduction
6,2,1,section,"The Founding Fathers, who decided to divide power, separated the government into three branches. The first is the Legislative branch, which makes laws; the second is the Executive branch, which enforces laws; and the third is the Judicial branch, which interprets laws. These are also known as the Congress, the President, and the Courts (Q.16). Among them, the President of the United States is responsible for the Executive branch (Q.17). And the department that writes laws in the federal government is the U.S. Congress, which is the Legislative branch (Q.18).",创建者们决定划分权力，将政府分为三个部门。第一个是立法部门，负责制定法律；第二个是行政部门，负责执行法律；第三个是司法部门，负责解释法律。它们也被称为国会、总统和法院 (Q.16)。其中，美国总统负责行政部门 (Q.17)。联邦政府中制定法律的部门是美国国会，即立法部门 (Q.18)。,"Ch2 Sec1 | Questions: [16, 17, 18]"
7,2,2,section,"This Congress had a special structure. It was divided into two chambers. One is the [ANSWER:Senate] and the other is the [ANSWER:House of Representatives] (Q.19). This Congress had immense power. It could [ANSWER:write bills], decide to [ANSWER:declare war], and was responsible for [ANSWER:creating the federal budget] (Q.20).",本届国会结构特殊。它分为两院。一院是 [ANSWER:参议院]，另一院是 [ANSWER:众议院] (Q.19)。本届国会拥有巨大权力。它可以 [ANSWER:起草法案]、决定 [ANSWER:宣战]，并负责 [ANSWER:制定联邦预算] (Q.20)。,"Ch2 Sec2 | Questions: [19, 20]"
8,2,3,section,"First, let's learn about the Senate, shall we? There are a total of [ANSWER:100] U.S. Senators (Q.21). Each Senator serves for a term of [ANSWER:6 years], working for a relatively long period (Q.22). Your state also has Senators. Their names vary by state, but each state must have two Senators (Q.23).",首先，我们来了解一下参议院，好吗？美国参议员总共有[ANSWER:100]名 (Q.21)。每位参议员任期为[ANSWER:6年]，工作时间相对较长 (Q.22)。你所在的州也有参议员。他们的名字因州而异，但每个州都必须有两名参议员 (Q.23)。,"Ch2 Sec3 | Questions: [21, 22, 23]"
9,2,4,section,"Now, let's look at the House of Representatives. There are many more members of the House. There are a total of [ANSWER:435] (Q.24). The term for a House member is [ANSWER:2 years], which is shorter than a Senator's term (Q.25). Why do House members have shorter terms? The reason is to [ANSWER:follow public opinion more closely], to hear the voices of the people more often (Q.26). Here's an interesting point. Each state has [ANSWER:2] Senators (Q.27). Why do all states have exactly two? This is to ensure [ANSWER:equal representation for smaller states]. This is famously known as the [ANSWER:Great Compromise], or the [ANSWER:Connecticut Compromise] (Q.28). Your area also has a House member (Q.29), and the House also has a Speaker who leads all members (Q.30).",现在，我们来看看众议院。众议院有更多的成员。总共有[ANSWER:435]名成员(Q.24)。众议院议员的任期是[ANSWER:2年]，比参议员的任期短(Q.25)。为什么众议院议员的任期较短？原因是[ANSWER:更紧密地追随民意]，更频繁地听取民众的声音(Q.26)。这里有一个有趣的重点。每个州有[ANSWER:2]名参议员(Q.27)。为什么所有州都只有两名？这是为了确保[ANSWER:小州的平等代表权]。这被著名地称为[ANSWER:大妥协]，或[ANSWER:康涅狄格妥协](Q.28)。你所在的地区也有众议院议员(Q.29)，众议院也有议长领导所有成员(Q.30)。,"Ch2 Sec4 | Questions: [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"
10,2,5,section,"So, who do these representatives represent? A Senator represents the [residents of their state] (Q.31). And the people who elect the Senator are also the [residents of their state] (Q.32). House Representatives are a little different. They represent [citizens of their congressional district], or rather, the [people of that district] (Q.33). And the ones who elect the House Representatives are the [citizens of their congressional district] (Q.34). In this way, Congress became an important institution that speaks for the voice of the people.",那么，这些代表代表谁呢？一位参议员代表[他们州的居民](Q.31)。选举参议员的人也是[他们州的居民](Q.32)。众议院代表则略有不同。他们代表[其国会选区的公民]，或者说，[该选区的人民](Q.33)。选举众议院代表的人是[其国会选区的公民](Q.34)。通过这种方式，国会成为了一个为民发声的重要机构。,"Ch2 Sec5 | Questions: [31, 32, 33, 34]"

13,3,1,section,"Finishing our story about Congress, one important question remains. Why do some states have more Representatives than others? The reason is [ANSWER:because of the state's population]. It's [ANSWER:because more people live there], and [ANSWER:because some states have more people] (Q.35). Now, let's move on to the Executive Branch.
